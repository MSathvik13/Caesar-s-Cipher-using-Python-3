# Caesar-s-Cipher-using-Python-3
Encrypting a sentence word by word using Caesar's Cipher with the help of Python 3

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

In our case we simply shift every character of a word, as many times as the length of the word.

Example: "AB CDF" will be encrypted into "CD FGI"
